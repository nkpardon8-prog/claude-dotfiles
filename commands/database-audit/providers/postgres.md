# database-audit — Vanilla Postgres Provider Adapter

This file is `Read` by the `/database-audit` orchestrator **only when the detected/forced provider is `postgres`** (the fallback when no Supabase or Neon signal matched). It declares (a) the connection method, (b) the prod-guard contribution, and (c) that there are NO platform modules — vanilla Postgres is the portable `core.md` floor and nothing more.

**Single source of truth:** every portable query (Q1.1–Q4.2) lives in `core.md`. This file does NOT repeat any query. Vanilla Postgres runs `core.md` and only `core.md`.

---

## (a) Connection

Direct `psql`, no control plane. Dispatch the core library **per module** (each module's queries in their own `psql` invocation), NOT as one big `ON_ERROR_STOP=1` batch over the whole library — a single batch aborts every remaining query on the first error, which breaks the per-module `[INFO] {tool} unavailable … continue` contract in `core.md`. With per-module dispatch, a single module's (or query's) error is logged `[INFO]` and the other modules still run. The `BEGIN READ ONLY; … ROLLBACK;` read-only wrapper still applies per dispatch:

```sql
-- one invocation per module (Module 1, then 2, then 3, then 4); ON_ERROR_STOP
-- scopes failure to THAT module only, so others still run.
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 <<'SQL'
BEGIN READ ONLY;
  -- this module's core query library Qx.y verbatim from core.md
ROLLBACK;
SQL
```

A module (or query) that errors → log `[INFO] Module N — {tool} unavailable: {error}` per `core.md` and continue with the next module's invocation. (This aligns with `guards.md`.)

- The `BEGIN READ ONLY; … ROLLBACK;` wrapper is the DB-enforced no-mutation guarantee (`guards.md` rule 6). It blocks WRITES; it does NOT discharge the prod guard.
- If the connection requires TLS and `$DATABASE_URL` lacks an SSL mode, append the `sslmode=require` parameter — but choose the separator conditionally: if the URL contains NO `?` (no existing query string), append `?sslmode=require`; if it ALREADY contains a `?` (existing query string), append `&sslmode=require`. Appending `?sslmode=require` unconditionally corrupts a URL that already has a query string. **Never echo `$DATABASE_URL`** (redaction rule 4 — key NAMES only).
- Connection SOURCE: explicit `$DATABASE_URL` only (no control plane to fall back to). If `$DATABASE_URL` is empty/unset → **no-connection-source case (a)**: there is no connection, hence no prod-data risk — this is NOT a prod-stop and NOT an abort. Hand off to the orchestrator's **Step 0a.6 no-connection-source path** — emit `[INFO] No DB connection/MCP available — SQL + platform modules skipped; filesystem checks only` (the historical `No connection source — set $DATABASE_URL. Core SQL skipped.` note may accompany it), run ONLY the zero-data-touch filesystem modules, assemble the partial report, and exit cleanly. Do NOT enter Phase 0b. Record `Connection source: none` in Meta.

### Preflight detection (Phase 0a)

`postgres` is the **fallback** provider — selected when neither the Supabase nor the Neon detection signals matched (and `--provider` was not forced). A non-empty `DATABASE_URL` whose host matches no known provider host falls through to `postgres` (it never auto-matches Supabase/Neon).

---

## (b) Prod-guard contribution — always PROD

Vanilla Postgres has **no control plane** to consult for branch/environment metadata, so the generalized prod guard (`guards.md`) resolves to **always PROD** (the safe default). Per the guard: if PROD and `--env=prod` was not passed, run only zero-data-touch modules, then STOP before opening any psql core session. The stop/resume prompt lives in `guards.md`.

```
postgres signal: always PROD (no control plane).
```

---

## (c) Platform modules — NONE

Vanilla Postgres has no provider-specific surface. It runs the portable `core.md` library (schema Q1.x, RLS Q2.x, security Q3.1/Q3.3, prod Q4.1/Q4.2) and nothing else.

**Modules 6–15 are CORE-ONLY on vanilla Postgres.** The expansion modules — Operational Health (`health`), Config/CIS (`config`), Privileges (`privileges`), Schema Integrity (`integrity`), Compliance/Encryption (`compliance`), PII (`pii`), Migration-safety lint (`migrations`, `[FS]`), Backup/Recovery (`backup`), Exfiltration (`exfil`) — all run from `core.md` via the portable SELECT-only library (and the filesystem path for Module 13). Vanilla Postgres has **no control plane**, so the new `--only` tokens select only their core checks; there are NO postgres-specific platform sections to add. In particular, the `[PROVIDER]` manual-verify items that Supabase/Neon own — at-rest encryption (`compliance`) and managed PITR / history-retention (`backup`) — have no vanilla analogue: at-rest encryption is the host/disk operator's responsibility (emit nothing / verify out-of-band), and PITR posture is assessed from the core SQL signals only (14.1 `pg_stat_archiver` WAL-archiving health + 14.2 `wal_keep_size`/`max_wal_size`).

Provider-supplied inputs to the core:

- **Supported Postgres major versions** (for portable Q4.1): `['14', '15', '16', '17', '18']`. List last updated: `2026-05`. This list EXCLUDES end-of-life majors (PostgreSQL 13 reached EOL 2025-11-13 and was removed) and INCLUDES new GA majors (PostgreSQL 18 reached GA in 2025 and was added — without it a PG18 DB would FALSELY emit the HIGH "unsupported version" finding). Review this list against the provider's version calendar periodically; EOL majors removed (PG13 EOL 2025-11), new GA majors added (PG18 GA 2025). A vanilla DB on an EOL major like 13 must emit the HIGH Q4.1 version finding, not pass clean. Review periodically against https://www.postgresql.org/support/versioning/ and drop majors as they reach EOL. Major version not in this list → HIGH. EOL staleness: if today is more than 18 months after `2026-05` → INFO "Postgres version support data may be stale; verify at postgresql.org."
- **Migration drift:** vanilla has no managed migrations API. Use on-disk migration files only, compared against a migrations bookkeeping table if one is present (per the `core.md` Migration drift note); otherwise emit INFO "no managed migration ledger — drift not checkable from DB."

### RLS-off is NOT auto-CRITICAL here (vanilla-context severity)

Q2.1 severity is CONTEXT-DEPENDENT (not a floor): CRITICAL when the table is reachable via an exposed data API (Supabase `anon` / Neon Data API), HIGH otherwise. On vanilla Postgres there is no `anon` role and no auto-generated public API (no PostgREST / Supabase Data API), so an RLS-disabled `public` table is NOT automatically exposed — this is the HIGH/vanilla case. The portable Q2.1 finding therefore resolves to **HIGH** here — RLS is still a missing defense-in-depth control, but the breach-on-by-default exposure that justifies CRITICAL in the Supabase/Neon-Data-API context is absent. Do not escalate Q2.1 to CRITICAL for `postgres`.

(This is the severity the Tier-1 Docker harness asserts — vanilla-context, not Supabase's CRITICAL.)

### Everything Supabase/Neon-specific emits INFO-N/A

- Security/performance advisors → `[INFO] advisors N/A — no control plane on vanilla Postgres.`
- Storage buckets / edge functions / realtime publications → `[INFO] N/A — Supabase-only surfaces.`
- Autoscaling / scale-to-zero / pooler / IP-allowlist / branch metadata → `[INFO] N/A — no control plane on vanilla Postgres.`
- Module 5 client coherence → `[INFO] Module 5 — no JS Supabase client; client-coherence N/A.`
- `generate_typescript_types` diff → `[INFO] generate_typescript_types N/A on vanilla Postgres.`
- DATABASE.md Edge Functions / Storage Buckets / Auth Providers sections render as `_N/A — not applicable to vanilla Postgres._` (Phase-7 template conditionalizes per provider).
